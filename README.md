## WGU C964 Capstone Project

### Project Objective
```
This is my Capstone project for the BSCS program at Western Governor's University.
The purpose of this machine learning project is to train a logistic regression
algorithm to predict the surival probability of horses with colic.

Colic in horses is a serious and often life-threatening gastrointestinal illness, 
and the leading cause of death in horses. The unpredictable nature and the variety 
of symptoms colic presents makes predicting the survival probability of horses 
challenging. The primary objective of this project is to implement Machine Learning 
using a dataset that contains detailed information of horse symptoms and treatments 
and whether the horse lived, died, or required euthanasia. By implementing this 
project I aim to remove relying solely on an individual veterinariansâ€™ medical 
experience concerning colic and enable veterinary medical staff to more effectively 
predict the horses' prognosis based on accurately calculated data, thereby improving 
overall treatment methods and predicting survival probability.

NOTE: The train.csv dataset was acquired from Kaggle.com.
